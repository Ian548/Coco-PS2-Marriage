I was feeling nostalgic recently and dug out my old Tandy Coco 2. It is in a bad way! Looking at the
date codes on the various chips inside it seems likely that this Coco was manufactured sometime in
1983 so it is not suprising that it is in poor condition. The case is badly yellowed and it has been
hacked at internally – not suprising as it waas made last century! After carefully removing the case top
I discovered that the RF modulator had presumably failed in the past and had been removed so the
video output now actually requires a monitor style device with composite video input instead of the old
TV set on channel 3 or 4. The memory had also been upgraded - piggyback style - using the Motorola
8040517 memory chip. Looking on the internet came up empty for the memory size of this chip,
however I believe it was a whole 16Kb device which likely doubled the original memory of the Coco
(WOW 32Kb RAM!!!).
Having found a monitor with a suitable composite video input I decided to fire up the Coco. This is
where the fun really started, only about half of the keys on the built in keyboard worked. After consulting the
internet again it appeared that the keyboard is a flex circuit design doubled over with crossover points in
the tracks that were shorted by pressing a key. The short should have been around 300 ohms or less so
I unplugged the keyboard from the main board and carried out continuity checks which changed every
time I tried them. Inspection of the plug part of the flex circuit revealed that of the 15 tracks the
majority were cracked. Tried the circuit pen on these tracks to try to restore the continuity but every
time I fixed one track another broke. The flex circuit is an acetate sheet which could not be soldered so
it appeared that I needed a new keyboard! Back to the internet but found nothing in my search and
being a bit of an electronic horder I didn’t want to just throw out the Coco so I would have to make a
newer keyboard do the job. I decided to use a PS2 keyboard for this as they are cheap and there is a
good supply of them – this is where the project started!!
